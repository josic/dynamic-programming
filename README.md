# dynamic-programming


dynamic_binary_observations - This is the implementation of a single observation case which is fully normative. See the latexed notes in this folder

dynamic_binary_test - This is a simplified version of the dynamic programming implementation. The probability of change between trials is zero, and
			   The beliefs are not normative, but are defined arbitrarily, and are related to the reward via an arbitrary logit function.

dynamic_test - This is an implementation of the dynamic programming optimization for the gambler's ruin problem as described in the 4th chapter of Sutton and Barto.
